<h1>OVERVIEW</H1>
<p>
    I'm a web developer with over eighteen years of experience working on high profile, high traffic, dynamic websites, APIs and related applications.
</p>
<p>
    I have worked with a number of technologies; although, my primary experience is with ASP.NET (C#, MVC and Razor), Native PHP and Drupal. 
    I also have extensive experience in front-end development including HTML/CSS and Javascript, including frameworks such as jQuery and Ext.js. 
    I've worked with a variety of relational databases and their related flavors of SQL including T-SQL, MySql and PL/SQL.
</p>
<p> 
    I know my way around a Linux server and have some experience with IIS. I set this site up on AWS as a Linux EC2 instance with PHP, SFTP and SES. 
    The front end uses Bootstrap with Sass. 
    Please see my <a href="/websites.php">projects page</a> for a description of some other sites I have worked on.
